Modules
-------

SCARAP is able to perform a number of specific tasks related to
prokaryotic comparative genomics (see also ``scarap -h``).

The most useful modules of SCARAP are probably the following:

-  ``pan``: infer a pangenome from a set of faa files
-  ``core``: infer a core genome from a set of faa files
-  ``sample``: sample a subset of representative genomes

Modules for other useful tasks are also available:

-  ``build``: build a profile database for a core/pangenome
-  ``search``: search query genes in a profile database
-  ``checkgenomes``: assess the genomes in a core genome
-  ``checkgroups``: assess the orthogroups in a core genome
-  ``filter``: filter the genomes/orthogroups in a pangenome
-  ``concat``: construct a concatenated core orthogroup alignment from a
   core genome
-  ``fetch``: fetch sequences and store in fasta per orthogroup
